# TraceShop Connect

## Objective

TraceShop Connect is envisioned to be a revolutionary Shopify app that leverages the power of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) to foster authenticity and transparency in the e-commerce space. By facilitating the seamless binding of Shopify products to knowledge assets, we aim to pave the way for mass adoption and a frictionless end-user onboarding experience onto the DKG ecosystem.

## Description

TraceShop Connect seeks to bridge the gap by breaking down the technical barrier of understanding the DKG ecosystem. Shopify merchants, Content Creators, Influencers, etc., who have a large following, will be able to seamlessly leverage the DKG ecosystem.

We are providing a platform where merchants can easily create and manage knowledge assets for their products. The app is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring a smooth onboarding process for merchants who are new or experienced with the DKG ecosystem.

## The Flow-Connect Process (tm) for exposure to the DKG ecosystem:

All parties from vendor to end-user will be exposed to the DKG ecosystem in a friction-less way.
The merchant must sign-up or sign-in for a wallet.
The merchant will pay with their Shopify billing to mint and use KAs.
The merchant will display a visible product verification badge and/or QR code on the product page.
The end-user will be able to confirm and verify the KA from the verification badge and/or QR code.
The end-user will be able to buy the product as usual by going through the checkout steps.
Finally, the end-user will receive an email to claim the KA that is associated with the product sale.

The architecture of TraceShop Connect will be built upon the following components:
